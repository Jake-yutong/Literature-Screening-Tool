  - Excluded records with documented exclusion reasons (for PRISMA reporting)

## Installation

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher** (Must be properly installed, not Windows Store version)
- pip package manager
- Supported operating systems: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)

### Option 1: One-Click Launch (Recommended)

**Windows:**

If you don't have Python installed:
1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. IMPORTANT: During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
3. Complete the installation and restart your computer

To run the tool:
1. Download this repository: Click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to any folder (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
3. Double-click `start.bat`
   - First run: Dependencies will be installed automatically (takes 1-2 minutes)
   - The terminal window will stay open showing server status
   - After approximately 3 seconds, your browser will open automatically to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
4. To stop: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window

**macOS:**

Method 1: Right-click shortcut (Recommended)
1. Download and extract this repository to any folder (e.g., Downloads or Desktop)
2. In Finder, locate the extracted folder
3. Right-click on the folder's empty space, select "New Terminal at Folder"
4. In the terminal window that appears, enter the following command (first run requires authorization):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
   ```
5. Wait 3 seconds, the browser will automatically open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
6. To stop the service: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

Method 2: Manual navigation (if right-click menu does not have terminal option)
1. Open the "Terminal" application (in Applications > Utilities)
2. Type `cd ` (cd followed by a space)
3. Drag and drop the extracted folder from Finder directly into the terminal window
4. Press Enter, then run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
   ```

Common Issues:
- If prompted "Cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer": Right-click `start.sh`, select "Open", then click "Open" again to confirm
- If Python command does not exist: First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run `brew install python3`

**Linux:**
1. Download and extract this repository
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/Literature-Screening-Tool  # 根据实际路径调整
   ```
3. Run the launcher script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
   ```
4. Your browser will open automatically to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jake-yutong/Results-Sifting-Tool.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd Results-Sifting-Tool

# Step 3: (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Step 4: Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Launch the application
python app.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Terminal closes immediately without output | Python is not installed correctly. Download from python.org and check "Add to PATH" during installation |
| "Python was not found" error | This is the Windows Store placeholder. Install real Python from python.org OR disable the placeholder in Settings → Apps → App execution aliases |
| Browser shows "Connection Refused" | Wait 5 seconds for the server to fully start, then refresh the page |
| Dependencies fail to install | Check your internet connection. If behind a proxy, configure pip with: `pip config set global.proxy http://your-proxy:port` |
| "Port 5000 already in use" (macOS) | **Automatic**: The tool will auto-switch to port 5001+<br>**Manual fix**: Disable AirPlay Receiver in System Settings → General → AirPlay Receiver (uncheck "Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices") |
| "Address already in use" error | The tool automatically finds an available port. Check the terminal output for the actual port number |
| Excel file read errors | Ensure files are in `.xlsx`, `.xls`, or `.csv` format with UTF-8 encoding |

## AI Configuration (Optional)

This tool supports two AI models for intelligent literature screening. Both models use natural language criteria for flexible and accurate filtering.

### DeepSeek Chat (Recommended for large batches)

**Advantages:**
- Fast response time (approximately 2-3 seconds per paper)
- Cost-effective pricing
- Stable JSON output format
- No strict rate limits

**Setup:**
1. Get your API key from [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
2. In the web interface, select "DeepSeek Chat" from the model dropdown
3. Enter your API key in the "API Key" field
4. Add natural language exclusion criteria (e.g., "Exclude all papers not about K-12 education")

**API Endpoint:** `https://api.deepseek.com`

### MiniMax-M2 (Best for accuracy)

**Advantages:**
- Advanced reasoning with thinking process
- Higher accuracy for complex criteria
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Handles ambiguous cases better

**Setup:**
1. Get your API key from [MiniMax Platform](https://platform.minimaxi.com/)
2. In the web interface, select "MiniMax-M2" from the model dropdown
3. Enter your API key in the "API Key" field
4. Add natural language exclusion criteria

**API Endpoints:**
- China: `https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic`
- International: `https://api.minimax.io/anthropic`

### Performance Comparison

| Feature | DeepSeek Chat | MiniMax-M2 |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Speed | Fast (2-3s/paper) | Moderate (4-5s/paper) |
| Accuracy | High | Very High |
| Cost | Low | Moderate |
| Thinking Process | No | Yes |
| Rate Limit | Generous | Standard |
| Best For | Large batches (100+ papers) | High-precision screening |

**Note:** The tool automatically selects the appropriate API endpoint based on your model choice.

2. **Configure** exclusion keywords for title/abstract and journal name fields
3. **(Optional)** Select AI model and provide API key for intelligent screening
4. **Run** the screening process
5. **Download** results:
